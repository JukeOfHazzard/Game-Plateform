# Game-Plateform
This is a space to put the coded scripts for a game made in Unreal Engine.
But unfortunately there are a lot of files in Unreal that I couldn't store here, so if you decide to try and download the game from here you'll be missing a couple of assets. Unreal Engine doesn't work with Git Hub like Unity does.

# Overview

are easy to use, thus easy to make a video Game.

The begginings of a game that will become a horror game. IT shows the proff of concept of picking things up,
using flashlight, placing assets, running, and doing other animations.

I wanted to understand the complexity of making a game and understand how heavy making a video game is.

The following Video is a lot longer than 4-5 minutes.
